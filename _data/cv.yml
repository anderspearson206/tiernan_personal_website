      institution: Sensor Systems Laboratory, Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, Seattle, WA
      year: 2024 - Current
      description:
        - Researching RF signal processing, artificial intelligence, and 6G wireless communication systems with Prof. Joshua Smith
        - Developed a novel, physics-informed deep learning framework for the NASA LunaNet program that outperformed all existing baselines, achieving a .9068 SSIM in predicting wireless network coverage on the moon.
        - Engineered a high-fidelity data pipeline in Python to generate a dataset of 65,000 radio maps, simulating lunar terrains and wave propagation using the NVIDIA Sionna ray-tracing engine, and spearheaded analyzing data and data cleaning
        - Developed and parallelized a custom terrain generator based on lunar topographic statistics, improving data generation speed by 10x
        - Designed and implemented a triplet-U-Net architecture with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to refine signal predictions by modeling wave propagation based on the Helmholtz equation in 3 dimensions.
        - Conducted comprehensive experiments and ablation studies yielding a 10% improvement in NMSE
        - Collaborated to co-author a research paper, which was submitted to the IEEE ICASSP 2026 conference.
