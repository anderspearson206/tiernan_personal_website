<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello, welcome to my website (still a work in progress). I am a concurrent B.S./M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington.

As a research assistant in the Sensor Systems Laboratory, I am advised by Professor Joshua Smith. My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and wireless communications.

My most recent work involves developing novel deep learning frameworks to predict wireless network coverage in challenging environments, with a special focus on future lunar missions for NASA's LunaNet program. I am passionate about applying signal processing and ML to problems here on earth or in space!
